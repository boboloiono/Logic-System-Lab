2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_1/btn_out_3 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_1//i_/O, cell design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_1//i_. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_2/btn_out_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_2//i_/O, cell design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_2//i_. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_3/btn_out_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_3//i_/O, cell design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_3//i_. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_4/btn_out_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_4//i_/O, cell design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_4//i_. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_1//i_ is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
design_1_i/top_0/inst/led_reg[3], design_1_i/top_0/inst/sel_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_2//i_ is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
design_1_i/top_0/inst/led_reg[2], design_1_i/top_0/inst/sel_reg[2]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_3//i_ is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
design_1_i/top_0/inst/led_reg[1], design_1_i/top_0/inst/sel_reg[1]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT design_1_i/top_0/inst/debounce_4//i_ is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
design_1_i/top_0/inst/led_reg[0], design_1_i/top_0/inst/sel_reg[0]
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
